# Fixes Applied - Voice AI Application

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Deepgram SDK Error: `dgLive.flush is not a function`

**Problem:** The code was calling `dgLive.flush()` which doesn't exist in Deepgram SDK v3.

**Solution:** Changed to `dgLive.finish()` which is the correct method to finalize the live transcription stream.

```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
dgLive.flush();

// After (CORRECT)
dgLive.finish();
```

**Location:** `realtime-server/src/index.ts` line ~142

### 2. 🔊 Reduced Console Log Flooding

**Problem:** Every audio chunk (5 per second) was logging, making it impossible to see important messages.

**Solution:**

- Server: Log every 10th audio chunk instead of every chunk
- Client: Log every 10th audio chunk instead of every chunk
- Added chunk counter to show total chunks sent

**Before:**

```
🎵 Sent audio chunk (785 bytes) to Deepgram
🎵 Sent audio chunk (804 bytes) to Deepgram
🎵 Sent audio chunk (877 bytes) to Deepgram
... (repeats 100+ times)
```

**After:**

```
🎵 [socket-id] Sent 10 audio chunks to Deepgram (latest: 785 bytes)
🎵 [socket-id] Sent 20 audio chunks to Deepgram (latest: 804 bytes)
⏹️  [socket-id] STOP_TALK event received (sent 47 total chunks)
```

### 3. ✅ Added Visual Transcription Display

**Problem:** No way to see what was being transcribed on the frontend.

**Solution:** Added two debug panels:

- **"YOU SAID" panel (Blue)**: Shows user's speech transcription in real-time
- **"AI SAYS" panel (Green)**: Shows AI's text response

These panels appear dynamically during conversation.

### 4. 🔌 WebSocket Connection

**Problem:** User reported WebSocket connection issues.

**Solution Confirmed:**

- Changed URL from `ws://localhost:8081` → `http://localhost:8080`
- Socket.IO client uses HTTP and upgrades to WebSocket automatically
- Server listens on port 8080
- CORS configured for `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working

1. WebSocket connection established correctly
2. Audio chunks being sent to Deepgram
3. Server receiving and forwarding audio data
4. All events properly logged
5. Deepgram stream finalization now works correctly

### ⚠️ To Verify

You need to check if Deepgram is actually transcribing. Look for:

```
📝 [socket-id] ASR PARTIAL: "text"
📝 [socket-id] ASR FINAL: "text"
```

If you DON'T see these messages, the issue is with Deepgram API:

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Invalid API Key** - Check `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` in `.env`
2. **No credits** - Check Deepgram dashboard for credit balance
3. **Wrong model** - `nova-2` should work for English
4. **Audio format issue** - We're sending Opus at 48kHz (should be correct)

---

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables

```bash
cd realtime-server
cat .env
```

Verify:

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx  # Should be a valid key
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx    # Should be a valid key
PORT=8080
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2: Start Server with Clean Console

```bash
cd realtime-server
pnpm dev
```

Expected output:

```
✅ Deepgram client initialized
Realtime server listening on :8080
```

### Step 3: Start Client

```bash
cd web
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in browser.

### Step 4: Test Voice Input

1. **Click "Push-to-talk (start)"**
2. **Speak clearly:** "Hello, how are you?"
3. **Click "Stop talk"**

### Step 5: Check Logs

**Browser Console Should Show:**

```
✅ WebSocket CONNECTED - Socket ID: xxx
🎙️  Sent START event to server
🎤 Push-to-talk STARTED
👂 Now LISTENING - Recording started
🎵 Sent 10 audio chunks to server
🎵 Sent 20 audio chunks to server
⏹️  Push-to-talk STOPPED
📤 Sending STOP_TALK to server
✅ ASR FINAL received: "Hello, how are you?"
🤖 Sending AGENT_REPLY to server with text: "Hello, how are you?"
💭 AI is thinking...
💬 AI REPLY TEXT received: "..."
🔊 TTS CHUNK received
✅ TTS DONE
```

**Server Console Should Show:**

```
✅ WebSocket client connected: xxx
🎙️  [xxx] START event received - lang: en-US
✅ [xxx] Deepgram live connection OPENED
🎵 [xxx] Sent 10 audio chunks to Deepgram
🎵 [xxx] Sent 20 audio chunks to Deepgram
⏹️  [xxx] STOP_TALK event received (sent 47 total chunks)
✅ [xxx] Deepgram stream finished
📝 [xxx] ASR FINAL: "Hello, how are you?"
🤖 [xxx] AGENT_REPLY event - User said: "Hello, how are you?"
💭 [xxx] Sent 'thinking' event to client
🧠 [xxx] Starting Gemini stream...
🧠 [xxx] Gemini chunk: "Hello"
💬 [xxx] Sending reply_text: "Hello!"
🔊 [xxx] Converting to speech: "Hello!"
✅ [xxx] TTS complete - sent 15 audio chunks
✅ [xxx] Agent reply complete
```

**Frontend UI Should Show:**

- Connection status: "connected" (green)
- Blue panel: "YOU SAID: Hello, how are you?"
- Green panel: "AI SAYS: [AI response]"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No ASR PARTIAL or ASR FINAL logs

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Invalid Deepgram API key**

   ```bash
   # Test your API key
   curl -X GET "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/projects" \
     -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_KEY"
   ```

2. **Insufficient credits**

   - Visit: https://console.deepgram.com/
   - Check: "Billing" section for credit balance

3. **Wrong audio encoding**

   - Current: Opus @ 48kHz
   - This should work, but you can try changing to:

   ```typescript
   encoding: 'linear16',
   sample_rate: 16000
   ```

4. **Deepgram WebSocket not opening**
   - Look for: `✅ [xxx] Deepgram live connection OPENED`
   - If missing, check for connection errors in logs

### Issue: ASR works but no AI response

**Check:**

1. Gemini API key is valid
2. Look for `🧠 [xxx] Starting Gemini stream...`
3. Check for Gemini errors in server logs

### Issue: AI response text but no audio

**Check:**

1. Look for `🔊 [xxx] Converting to speech:`
2. Check for TTS API errors
3. Verify Deepgram API key has TTS enabled
4. Test TTS API directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-asteria-en" \
     -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text":"Hello world"}' \
     --output test.mp3
   ```

---

## API Key Testing

### Test Deepgram API Key

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.deepgram.com/v1/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_KEY"
```

Should return project information, not 401/403 error.

### Test Gemini API Key

```bash
curl -X POST "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=YOUR_GEMINI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Say hello"}]}]}'
```

Should return a response, not authentication error.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart both servers** to apply the fixes
2. **Test voice input** following the steps above
3. **Check logs** in both browser and server console
4. **Look for the specific log messages** listed above

If you still don't see transcription after these fixes, the issue is likely with:

- Deepgram API key validity
- Deepgram account credits
- Microphone permissions in browser
- Audio format compatibility

Share the exact logs you see (especially looking for 📝 ASR messages) and I can help debug further!
